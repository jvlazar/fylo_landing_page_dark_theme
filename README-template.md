## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript and CSS


### What I learned

- How to use the *background: linear gradient* property to change the background color of the site
- How to start working on a design with a mobile-first approach
- How to use *display: grid* and the accompanying properties to evenly (and unevenly) display information


```css
.element_using_background_color_change{
  background: linear-gradient(hsl(218, 28%, 13%) 78%, hsl(216, 53%, 9%) 33%) no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development
- Figure out how to make the background colors change at a specific part of the screen/layout, not just in response to screen size
- Make the email verification function more accurate (i.e. check to see if the domain is valid)
- Become more comfortable in working with *display: grid* and how to adjust the placement of the elements inside the grid exactly how I want them to be
